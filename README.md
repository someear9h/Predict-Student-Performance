# Predict-Student-Performance
Student Performance Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to predicting students' academic performance using various features. The primary goal is to understand how factors like the number of past failures, parental education, study time, and other attributes impact students' performance.

Objectives
Predict Student Performance: Utilize linear regression models to forecast academic outcomes based on several predictors.
Analyze Features: Investigate how each feature contributes to the prediction of students' performance.
Features Included
Number of Past Failures: Analyzes how prior academic struggles affect current performance.
Parental Education Level: Examines the correlation between parents' education and students' academic success.
Study Time: Evaluates the impact of time dedicated to studying on performance.
Health Status: Considers students' health as a factor influencing their academic achievements.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Train a linear regression model using the processed data to predict student performance.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Google Colab).
Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the analyses and view results.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
Conclusion
This notebook serves as a practical exercise in applying linear regression models to real-world problems. Through this project, insights can be gained into the factors affecting student performance, which can be beneficial for educators and policymakers.
